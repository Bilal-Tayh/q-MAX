# "q-MAX: A Unified Scheme for Improving Network Measurement Throughput" Source Code

This repository contains the source code of the "q-MAX: A Unified Scheme for Improving Network Measurement Throughput", by Ran Ben Basat, Gil Einziger, Junzhi Gong, Jalil Moraney, and Danny Raz (ACM IMC 2019).

This code  implements the varaints of q-MAX algorithm presented in the paper: Interval, Sliding Window and Exponential-Decay. The code works on several real-life traces and can be easily extended to other traces.
